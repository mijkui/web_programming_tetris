# Tetris Game Guide

## 🎮 Game Overview

Tetris is a classic puzzle game invented by Russian programmer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. It has become one of the most popular video games of all time.

### Game Objective

The goal of the game is to fill complete horizontal lines by moving, rotating, and placing falling blocks (Tetrominoes) that drop from the top of the screen. When a line is completely filled, it disappears, the blocks above fall down, and the player earns points. As the game progresses, blocks fall faster and the difficulty increases.

## 🎯 Game Strategies

### Basic Tips

1. **Keep the Board Flat**
   - Try to keep the stack flat, avoid high peaks
   - Prioritize filling low gaps

2. **Reserve Space for I-Piece**
   - Keep a 4-block wide vertical channel on one side
   - When you get an I-piece, you can clear 4 lines at once (Tetris)

3. **Use Hold Strategically**
   - Hold I-pieces for multi-line clears
   - Hold O-pieces for filling corners

4. **Watch the Next Pieces**
   - Plan ahead for the next piece's placement
   - Adjust strategy based on upcoming pieces

5. **Use the Ghost Piece**
   - The ghost piece shows where the current piece will land
   - Helps you place pieces precisely

### Advanced Techniques

1. **T-Spin**
   - Use T-pieces with rotation placement
   - Can earn bonus points and clear difficult lines

2. **Combo Clears**
   - Plan consecutive multi-line clears
   - Clearing multiple lines at once scores higher than separate clears

3. **Speed Control**
   - Build a good foundation at lower levels
   - Stay calm and make quick decisions at higher levels
