The goal of the game is to fill complete horizontal lines by moving, rotating, and placing falling blocks (Tetrominoes) that drop from the top of the screen. When a line is completely filled, it disappears, the blocks above fall down, and the player earns points. As the game progresses, blocks fall faster and the difficulty increases.
